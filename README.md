# Flutter Extended Zeplin Extension ðŸ’»

This is a new Flutter Extended version of the actual Extension to help a lot of people who need more components than TextStyles and Colors and RichTexts. With this new one you have the opportunity to have more info about Widgets, for example, generate Container elements, BoxDecoration Widget with Shadows, Linear Gradients, Fills, Borders, Opacity and several components more. Coming soon RadialGradient and SweapGradient and also Components as buttons and others. 

## Getting started

Add the extension to your project from [extensions.zeplin.io](https://extensions.zeplin.io), then test the extension and give me your comments about possible improvements. I will try giving frequently support to this extension.

## Output

#### `Container with Border and Shadow` 

```
new Container(
  width: 128,
  height: 172,
  decoration: new BoxDecoration(
    color: Color(0xff1b1b1b),
border: Border.all(
      color: Color(0xfff19528),
      width: 1
    ),
		boxShadow: [BoxShadow(
        color: Color(0x29000000),
        offset: Offset(0,3),
        blurRadius: 6,
        spreadRadius: 0

    ) ],

  )
)
```

There are several features to modify in the futere, first of them will be add more options to Gradients, adding two more Radial and Sweap.
